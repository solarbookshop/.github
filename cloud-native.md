# Introduction to Cloud Native

## What is Cloud Native
On May 28, 2010, Paul Fremantle, a veteran of the cloud industry, wrote a post on his blog titled “[Cloud Native](http://pzf.fremantle.org/2010/05/cloud-native.html).”1 He was among the first to use the term cloud native. At a time when concepts and technologies like microservices, Docker, DevOps, Kubernetes, and Spring Boot didn’t yet exist, Fremantle discussed what it takes for “applications and middleware to work well in a cloud environment”—to be cloud native—with his team at WSO2.

The key concept explained by Fremantle is that cloud native applications should be specifically designed for the cloud and have properties that take advantage of the cloud environment and the cloud computing model. You can move a traditional application (designed to run on the ground) to the cloud, an approach commonly referred to as “lift and shift,” but that doesn’t make the application native to the cloud. Let’s see what does.

### The Three P's of Cloud Native
What does it mean for applications to be designed specifically for the cloud? The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) answers that question in its cloud native [definition](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/DEFINITION.md):

    Cloud native practices empower organizations to develop, build, and deploy workloads in computing environments (public, private, hybrid cloud) to meet their organizational needs at scale in a programmatic and repeatable manner. It is characterized by loosely coupled systems that interoperate in a manner that is secure, resilient, manageable, sustainable, and observable.

    Cloud native technologies and architectures typically consist of some combination of containers, service meshes, multi-tenancy, microservices, immutable infrastructure, serverless, and declarative APIs — this list is non-exhaustive.


- **Platforms:** Cloud native applications run on platforms based on dynamic, distributed environments: the clouds (public, private, or hybrid).
- **Properties:** Cloud native applications are designed to be scalable, loosely coupled, resilient, manageable, and observable.
- **Practices:** Practices around cloud native applications—automation, continuous delivery, and DevOps—include robust automation combined with frequent and predictable changes.
